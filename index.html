                <p align='center' >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wrote this in a couple months using javascript and canvas. The rotation for
                line blocks is the transpose of a 4x4, and all other blocks are rotated by the column-swapped transpose of a 3x3.
                Being a complete newbie with Tetris, I wrote the game to the original Tetris' standards so no fancy ARS/SRS-ghostblock business.
                Directional keys for strafing, rotation, and soft drop. Spacebar for hard drop.</p>
